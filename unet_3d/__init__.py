@section intro_sec Introduction
This package contains classes and functions for 3D U-Net model architecture.
It includes plain, residual, and pre-activation residual 3D U-Net models.

@section usage_sec Usage
For plain 3D U-Net model, use unet_3d_plain.py
For residual 3D U-Net model, use unet_3d_residual.py
For pre-activation residual 3D U-Net model, use unet_3d_pre_activation.py

@note This package is developed based on the model architecture in paper "an attempt to beat 3D U-Net" by Isensee et al.
